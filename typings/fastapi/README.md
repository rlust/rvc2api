# FastAPI Type Stubs

This directory contains type stubs for FastAPI to improve type checking and IDE support in the rvc2api project.

## Organization

The FastAPI type stubs are organized into two primary files:

- `__init__.py` - Implementation file with detailed docstrings
- `__init__.pyi` - Type stub file with concise type definitions

## Design Decisions

1. **Consolidated Structure**: All type stubs are consolidated into these two files instead of spread across multiple files to simplify imports and maintenance.

2. **Complete WebSocket Support**: Special attention is given to WebSocket classes (`WebSocket`, `WebSocketDisconnect`, and `WebSocketException`) since they are critical to the project's functionality.

3. **Non-standard Naming**: The `Body()` function maintains its PascalCase name for compatibility with FastAPI's actual API, despite Python's naming conventions. This is specifically exempted from linting rules in `pyproject.toml`.

## Usage

To use these type stubs in your code, import FastAPI components normally:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect

# The type hints will be properly resolved by Pylance/Pyright
```

## Customization

If additional FastAPI components need type definitions:

1. Add the component to `__init__.py` with complete docstrings and implementation details
2. Add corresponding stub definitions to `__init__.pyi`

## Reference

These type stubs are maintained to match FastAPI's actual behavior while providing improved type information for IDE tools and static type checkers.
